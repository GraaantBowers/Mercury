    <h1>Olbers’ Paradox</h1>
    <p>And I heard the learned astronomer<br />
    whose name was Heirich Olbers<br />
    speaking to us across the centuries<br />
    about how he observed with naked eye<br />
    how in the sky there were<br />
    some few stars close up<br />
    and the further away he looked<br />
    the more of them there were<br />
    with infinite numbers of clusters of stars<br />
    in myriad Milky Ways &amp; myriad nebulae<br />
    So that from this we can deduce<br />
    that in the infinite distances<br />
    there must be a place<br />
    there <em>must</em> be a place<br />
    where all is light<br />
    and that the light from that high place<br />
    where all is light<br />
    simple hasn’t got here yet<br />
    which is why we still have night<br />
    But when at last that light arrives<br />
    when at last it does get here<br />
    the part of day we now call Night<br />
    will have a white sky<br />
    with little black dots in it<br />
    little black holes<br />
    where once were stars<br />
    And then in that symbolic<br />
    so poetic place<br />
    which will be ours<br />
    we’ll be our own true shadows<br />
    and our own illumination<br />
    on a sunset earth.</p>
