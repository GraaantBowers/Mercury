    <h1>Where You At?</h1>
    <p>What follows is a self-scoring test on basic environmental
    perception of place. Scoring is done on the honor system, so if you
    fudge, cheat, or elude, you also get an idea of where you’re at. The
    quiz is culture bound, favoring those people who live in the country
    over city dwellers, and scores can be adjusted accordingly. Most of
    the questions, however, are of such a basic nature that undue
    allowances are not necessary.</p>
