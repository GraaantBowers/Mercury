    <h1>Walden</h1>
    <p>Most of the luxuries, and many the so called comforts of life,
    are not only not indispensable, but positive hinderances to the
    elevations of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the
    wisest have ever lived a more simple and meager life than the poor.
    The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo [sic], Persian, and Greek,
    were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none
    so rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable
    that <em>we</em> know so much of them as we do. The same is true of
    the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race. None can be
    an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage
    ground of what we shall call voluntary poverty.</p>
